Clustering song lyrics using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for Data Mining course final project. The goal is to group songs based on the similarity of their lyrics, enabling deeper analysis of themes, genres, and emotional content in music.

## Features

- **Lyrics Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares raw song lyrics text for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts lyrics into numerical features using methods like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- **Clustering Algorithms**: Supports clustering with algorithms such as K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical Clustering.
- **Visualization**: Generates visualizations of clustered songs, including dimensionality reduction (PCA, t-SNE) plots.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics and tools to assess clustering quality.
